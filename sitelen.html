<h1>sitelen</h1>
<h2> nimi kulupu wan lon sitelen Pasenapopitiwan. </h2>
<h3> first paragraph of Fahrenheit 451. </h2>
<p> It was a pleasure to burn. It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things
blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.
</p>
<p>
ona li seli e ijo la ona li pilin pona suli.
seli li moku li pimeja li ante e ijo la ona li pilin e nasin wan pi pilin pona. ona li jo e akesi linja pi poki linja la ona li telo pana e telo moli pi telo seli tawa ma ni. telo loje li tawa telo wawa lon lawa ona. luka ona li luka pi jan musi. ona li musi e musi seli ali tawa sitelen pi tenpo pini. sitelen pi tenpo pini li pimeja. seli li moku e sitelen pi tenpo pini.
 </p>
<p> he burns things then he feels happy. fire eats things, it blackens things, it changes things, then he feels unique happiness. he has a hose snake then he sprays fire-liquid venom to this place. blood is flowing strongly in his head. his hands are musicians' hands. this is playing the every fire song to the past time writings. past time writings are black. fire eats the past time writings. </p>
<h2>sitelen pi ma Alonese </h2>
<h3> the elegy for hollow nest </h2>
<p> In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,
For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,
Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed,
A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.
- From 'Elegy for Hallownest' by Monomon the Teacher</p>
<p>ona li toki e nimi sina lon ma ike. ona li toki kepeken pilin like
jan ala li lawa ken e nasin ike mi. sina pali e ni
walo li oko e sina. sina sona e mi la mi ante. nasin pi nanpa wan li kama
sina pana e ma tawa pipi tawa akesi. tenpo pini la ona li sona ala e ma ni
- tan sitelen pi ma Alonese tan jan sona Monomon</p>
<p> they say your name in the bad place. they speak with bad feelings.
no person can control our bad ways. you did this.
white looked at you. you taught us then we changed. our first way came.
you gave place to bug and reptiles. in the past time, they didnt know this place.
- from the hollownest place writing from teacher Monomon. </p>
